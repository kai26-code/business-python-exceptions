# It alerts the user when inventory falls below the reorder threshold
# and safely handles division errors.

Exercise 3: Customer age verification 
# validates customer age input using exceptions.
# It determines eligibility for age restricted promotions and demonstrates
# handling both ValueError and NameError.    

Exercise 4: Financial ratio calculator
# calculates profit margin (profit / revenue).
# It demonstrates defensive programming using try-except-else,
# handling ValueError and ZeroDivisionError.    

Exercise 5: Employee salary adjustment 
# Simulates salary adjustments for employees in an HR setting.
# prompts user to enter an employee's current salary and an adjustment
# percentage. The program validates user input using exception to

# range. Once valid inputs are received, the program calculates
# and displays the employee's new adjusted salary.
